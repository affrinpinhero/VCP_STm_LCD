@par Example Description
This example describes how to use a ADC peripheral to perform 
a single ADC conversion of the internal temperature sensor 
and to calculate the temperature in Celsius degrees; 
Example using programming model: polling 
(for programming models interrupt or DMA transfer, refer to
other examples); 
This example is based on the STM32F4xx ADC LL API; 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
Sequencer of group regular (default group available on ADC of all STM32 devices)
is configured to convert 1 channel: internal channel temperature sensor.

Example execution:
At each press on User Button, the ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected channel.
Software polls for conversion completion.
When conversion is completed, main program reads conversion data
from ADC data register and stores it into a variable, LED2 is turned on.

ADC conversions raw data are computed to physical values
using LL ADC driver helper macro:
 - Value of temperature (unit: degree Celcius)

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "hADCxConvertedData_Temperature_DegreeCelsius": Value of temperature (unit: degree Celcius)

Connection needed:
None.

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User Button
  1 GPIO for LED2
